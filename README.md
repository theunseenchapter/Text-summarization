## üìñ How It Works

### 1. Input Processing
Your text is tokenized and preprocessed using advanced NLP techniques to prepare it for analysis.

### 2. AI Analysis
Machine learning models identify key concepts, relationships, and important information within the text.

### 3. Content Selection
Important sentences are ranked and selected based on relevance scores and semantic understanding.

### 4. Summary Generation
The final summary is generated while maintaining context, coherence, and the original meaning.
