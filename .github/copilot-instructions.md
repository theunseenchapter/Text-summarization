# AI Text Summarizer Project Instructions

This is a modern web application for AI-powered text summarization built with:
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **TailwindCSS** for modern, responsive styling with glassmorphism effects
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for core functionality
- **Font Awesome** for icons

## Project Structure
- Modern, elegant UI with soft color tones (blue, lavender, soft beige)
- Glassmorphism design with soft shadows and blur effects
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Light/dark mode toggle functionality
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Key Features
- Text input area with file upload support
- Extractive vs Abstractive summarization methods
- AI-powered text analysis and summarization
- Side-by-side comparison of different methods
- Metrics display (compression ratio, processing time, method used)
- Copy, download, and share functionality
- Educational "How It Works" section
- Interactive notifications and loading states

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use ES6+ modern JavaScript features
- Implement clean, modular class-based architecture
- Follow responsive design principles
- Use semantic HTML and accessible design patterns
- Implement smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Maintain consistent styling with TailwindCSS utility classes

## AI Integration Notes
- Currently uses simulated AI for demonstration purposes
- Extractive summarization uses TF-IDF and sentence ranking
- Abstractive summarization uses template-based generation
- Ready for integration with real AI models (NLTK, T5, BART, GPT)

When making changes:
- Maintain the glassmorphism aesthetic
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes
- Keep animations smooth and purposeful
- Follow the established color scheme and design patterns
- Test both light and dark modes
